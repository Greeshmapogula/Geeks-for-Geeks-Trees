# Geeks-for-Geeks-Trees

Created this repository to save the codes I have done in **Geeks for Geeks** Tree and Graph data structure tags.

link to do practice : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?category%5B%5D=Tree&difficulty%5B%5D=-1&page=1

6. Preorder Traversal
7. Postorder Traversal
8. Sum of Binary Tree
9. Count Non-Leaf Nodes in Tree
10. Height of Heap
